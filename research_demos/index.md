**[Network analysis of heat transfer](8-network-analysis.md)**  
Quantify microstructure using complex network theory (graph theory). Construct both contact and thermal networks and use their features to predict thermal conductivity of sphere packings and natural sands.

**[Thermal Conductance Network Model](7-TCNM.md)**  
An alternative method to simulate heat transfer.

**[Rigidity of sands and its impact on heat transfer](4-rigidity.md)**  
Rigidity is quantified using complex network theory. Particle shape and local clustering coefficient well relate to predict thermal conductivity of granular materials under loading.
