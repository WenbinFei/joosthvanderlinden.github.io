**[The relationship between weighted coordination number, particle shape and ETC](6-ANN.md)**  
Weighted coordination number can capture both particle connectivity and contact quality.

**[The relationship between closeness centrality, local clustering coefficient and ETC](5-sphere-network-features.md)**  
Closeness centrality and local clustering coefficient are good to predict thermal conductivity of sphere packings.

**[Rigidity of sands and its impact on heat transfer](4-rigidity.md)**  
Rigidity is qutified using complex network theofy. Particle shape and local clustering coefficient well relate to predict thermal conductivity of granular materials under loading.
