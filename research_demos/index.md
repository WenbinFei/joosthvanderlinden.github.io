**[Quantifying the impact of rigid interparticle structures on heat transfer in granular materials using networks](4-rigidity.md)**  
Particle shape and local clustering coefficient are good to predict thermal conductivity of granular materials under loading.

**[PhD project](0-phd-project.md)**  
Particle scale study on fluid flow and heat flow in granular materials

**[Porous media](1-porous-media.md)**<br />
Porous media is ubiquitous such as sponge, candy, sand, snow, bone...

**[Particle shape](2-particle-shape.md)**  
Sphericity and roundness of every single particle in soil or rock samples

**[THMC coupling analysis at field scale](3-AEEA-coupler.md)**  
AEEA coupler linking ABAQUA and ECLIPSE
