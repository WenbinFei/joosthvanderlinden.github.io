**[The relationship between weighted coordination number, particle shape and ETC](6-ANN.md)**  
Weighted coordination number can capture both particle connectivity and contact quality.

**[The relationship between closeness centrality, local clustering coefficient and ETC](5-sphere-network-features.md)**  
Closeness centrality and local clustering coefficient are good to predict thermal conductivity of sphere packings.

**[Quantifying the impact of rigid interparticle structures on heat transfer in granular materials using networks](4-rigidity.md)**  
Particle shape and local clustering coefficient are good to predict thermal conductivity of granular materials under loading.

**[Three dimensional (3D) Particle shape descriptors computation based on Computed Tomography (CT) images](2-particle-shape.md)**  
Sphericity and roundness of every single particle in soil or rock samples

**[THMC numerical simulation for complex industrial projects](3-AEEA-coupler.md)**  
AEEA coupler linking ABAQUA and ECLIPSE
