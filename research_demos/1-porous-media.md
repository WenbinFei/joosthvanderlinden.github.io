### Porous media are ubiquitous around us
Candy, sand, snow and rice are porous media.

### My work on porous media
I am working on porous media at various scale.

My methodology involves imaging techniques together with several advanced numerical modeling techniques. My project includes the investigation of effects of multi-scale features on mechanical, fluid and heat flow.
