In this blog post, I will share my story and experiences on running a "datathon." Running one yourself? Feel free to skip my story and scroll straight down to the concept & tips section.

### Founding the Melbourne Datathon
Back in December 2014, I read a few [articles](http://www.datanami.com/2014/11/24/datathons-emerge-training-recruitment-tool/) about the concept of a datathon and I thought it would be fun to organize one in Melbourne. But where to start? I had just started going to the local data science Meetup. I got in touch with the organizer (Phil Brierley) who was immediately excited about the idea too. Lucky for me, Phil knows practicaLly everyone and everything doing data science in Melbourne. I had found myself a co-organizer.

Countless meetings and coffees followed, during which time we hashed out the format. We got together with a small web development startup ([Zuse Digital](http://www.zusedigital.com/)) to set up a website for us. Thanks to the Meetup, finding venues and sponsors proved relatively straightforward. Our friends and colleagues (even my wife!) got involved to help out with logistics and communication. We attracted a group of data "executives" to serve as our jury and got a group of experts together to be the mentors during the event. I also saw an opportunity in making our event part of the [Melbourne Knowledge Week](http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/arts-and-culture/events-partnerships/melbourne-knowledge-week/Pages/melbourne-knowledge-week.aspx), adding to our exposure outside the Meetup and integrating our event with the city's objective of promoting the knowledge sector.  

The most challenging aspect of organizing the datathon turned out to be finding the dataset. We wanted a new, previously unreleased dataset, to make sure there were no questions/answers out there, and to make the datathon more attractive. Initially, we set our sights on data from the local smartcard ticketing system (Myki) for public transport. Unfortunately for us, the Myki system carries A LOT of political baggage. Even though we got as high as the state's Minister for Public Transport, there was just not enough incentive (and too much risk) in the government to release the data. 

Moving on from our "holy grail," we started chasing down countless other leads. We continued searching in the government sector for a while, talking to the Health Department, Economic Development, VicRoads, Australia Post, Forest Management and Ambulance Victoria, but nothing really seemed to pan out. Although open data is gaining momentum in [Melbourne](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/) and [Victoria](https://www.data.vic.gov.au/), often we found that a dataset was too politically senstive, already public or was to be made public on a date that did not align with our planning. We also searched in the corporate sector, meeting with representatives from various banks and IT companies, as well as a credit rating agency and an employment marketplace. Here, our main roadblock was often the legal team. Despite the benefit of having a group of eager data-enthusiasts sifting through the data and our offer to set up a non-disclosure agreement, not everyone was too keen on the idea of having their data out in the open. 

After months of searching, we finally found a corporate partner (Betfair) who was willing to share a really interesting dataset from their betting marketplace. Although not everyone was too happy about the idea of working with betting data, the data did offer everything we were looking for: a temporal element, a spatial element and a "people" element. Interestingly, some teams ended up using the dataset "for good" by analyzing suspicious betting behaviour and money laundering.

The 2015 edition itself was a success. About 120 people showed up on the hackday, 22 teams submitted an entry and close to 200 people saw the top 5 contenders pitch their insights, visualisations and predictions to our industry panel. Between the pitching competition and the subsequent Kaggle competition, winning teams took home $4,000 in prize money. [Mat Kelcey](http://matpalm.com/blog/) from Google talked about recurrent neural networks in between the pitches. Finally, arguably most appreciated was the free bartab afterwards!

### Scaling up

### Onwards
Looking back, even though we were turned down 9/10 times, it was incredibly exciting to be able to peek into everyone's "data kitchen."

### Concept & tips
There is a lot of help available on running traditional hackathons (like [this](http://hackdaymanifesto.com/) page) but very little guidance tailored to running a hackathon for data science. Therefore, I am sharing my experiences here in hopes of helping other data-enthusiasts getting started.

The concept is simple. We provide the dataset; participants provide insights. There are no set tasks and there is very little initial guidance. Instead, we ask people to come up with their own questions. What is the value in the data? What are the business opportunities? What could the data be connected with to create new insights? Essentially, we want the datathon to be just like a real data science consulting job. 

#### Things to look for in the dataset
Use list 

#### 3 biggest challenges
1. Getting the dataset 
2. Budgeting for a free event 
3. Finding sponsors and venues
