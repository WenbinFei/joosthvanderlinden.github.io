### Porous media are ubiquitous around us
Porous media and granular materials are everywhere around us, such as candy, rice, snow, sand...

Conduction phenomena, especially heat transfer and fluid flow, THROUGH these granular, porous media have numerous applications:
- Construction materials
- Recovery of oil and gas, fracking
- Geothermal engineering that our group is well know for
- Disposal of nuclear waste
- Buried earth structures
- CO2 geological storage

I am trying to characterise the microstructure of porous media and analyse the effects of multi-scale microsturtual features on mechanical, fluid and heat flow.
