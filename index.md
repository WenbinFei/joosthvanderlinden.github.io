I am an applied mathematician at heart, engineering geek, data analytics enthusiast and computer science fanatic. I enjoy traveling, running, a clean inbox and a minimal website.

Currently, I am a PhD student in Engineering at The University of Melbourne. I study complex networks and machine learning in granular media. On the side, I run the Melbourne Datathon and I work as a data scientist for Our Community. Previously, I completed my BSc and MSc degrees in Applied Mathematics at Delft University of Technology. I interned at IBM and Schlumberger, working in scientific computing.
