I am at heart a geotechnical engineer who likes studying thermal–hydraulic–mechanical–chemical (THMC) process in geomaterials at multiscales. From micro scale to labratory scale, I adopt image techniques and complex theory to investigate the optimal features dominating physics. At the field scale, I combine different commerical software with home-made code to simulate the large projects.

Currently, I am  pursuing a Ph.D. degree in the University of Melbourne. Previously, I holds a BS diploma of geology engineering from Chang‘an University, China (2011), and in 2014 Ｉ received an MS in Architectural and Civil Engineering from Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics (IRSM). Before starting my Ph.D, I worked as a road engineer at China Railway Siyuan Survey and Design Group Co., LTD.
