I am an applied mathematician at heart, engineering geek, data analytics enthusiast and computer science fanatic. I strive to learn, experience and grow. I also enjoy traveling, running and a clean inbox.

Currently, I am a PhD student in Engineering at The University of Melbourne. I study complex networks and machine learning in granular media. Previously, I completed a BSc and MSc in Applied Mathematics at Delft University of Technology. I also interned at IBM and Schlumberger, working mostly in scientific computing.
