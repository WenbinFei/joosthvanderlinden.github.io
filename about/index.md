My passion is to discover the mechanism of thermal–hydraulic–mechanical–chemical (THMC) process in geomaterials at multi-scale, then apply the findings to engineering applications. Now, I am working on the fluid flow and heat flow in porous media at particle scale and laboratory scale using image processing and machine learning techniques. In order to finish my [PhD project](../research_demos/0-phd-project.md), I need to work as a Data Scientist to extract the features in geometerials and discover the relationship between various scales. During my master period, I coupled ABAQUS and ECLIPSE to simulate the THMC process of Carbon Dioxide Storage at filed scale.

The outputs of my research can also be implemented for other engineering applications such as:

- In geothermal engineering, this project will guide the material selection of high-quality grout which requires high thermal conductivity and low hydraulic conductivity. 
- In nuclear waste disposal engineering, this project will help in the design of engineered barrier which needs low hydraulic permeability and a self-sealing (deformation) ability.
- The results of this project will assist in predicting the macro-scale behaviour of methane hydrate-bearing soils, which are sensitive to thermal, hydraulic, mechanical and chemical conditions.

Furthermore, I worked as a road engineer and have the experience of designing both urban roads and highways. My work also involved the design about sponge city. Now, I also working as a testing engineer which offer me a better understanding of what parameters are required for different engineering applications and how they are achieved.

**Summary**

I have the research experience on multi-physic of geomaterials at multi-scale as well as the working experience of a civil engineer.
