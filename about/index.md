My passion is to combine applied mathematics and computer science in engineering and data science applications. I excel in environments with ample learning opportunities. Currently, I am lucky enough to build on all of these things in my PhD.

<b>Highlights</b>

- BSc and MSc in Applied Mathematics from The Delft University of Technology (cum laude)
- Currently working towards a PhD at The University of Melbourne, applying machine learning and complex networks to porous media
- Research internships at Schlumberger, IBM and for a small energy consultant (Alboran), where I learned how to connect, communicate and collaborate
- Data science jobs for a Dutch railway company (Keyrail) and as a freelancer in Melbourne, where I found my career path
- Founder and organiser of the <a href="http://www.datasciencemelbourne.com/datathon">Melbourne Datathon</a> (150 participants!)

<b>I can talk for hours about</b>

- Data science and machine learning. I read everything on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearning">r/machinelearning </a> 
- My MSc research on numerical linear solvers and preconditioning, which got published in the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2015.10.016">Journal of Computational Physics</a>, the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3997/2214-4609.20141773">ECMOR XIV conference</a>, several workshops and <a href="http://repository.tudelft.nl/view/ir/uuid:47cbb291-6b1e-4572-b384-f79a8cf7e535/">my thesis</a>
